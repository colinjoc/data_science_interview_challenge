# ds_challenge
A challenge for a job interview I did in April 2019 (Iwont mention the company). I succesfully passed this interview stage.

I was given the data.csv, header.txt, and dict.txt files, I then performed the analysis in the jupyter notebook file. 
There is a technical report also contained in this repo.
